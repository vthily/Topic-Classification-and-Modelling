An economy is an area of the production, distribution, or trade, and consumption of goods and services by different agents in a given geographical location. Understood in its broadest sense, 'The economic is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use and management of resources'. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency, but monetary transactions are only a small part of the economic domain.  Economic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources, labor, and capital. It has changed over time due to technology (automation, accelerator of process, reduction of cost functions), innovation (new products, services, processes, new markets, expands markets, diversification of markets, niche markets, increases revenue functions) such as that which produces intellectual property and changes in industrial relations (for example, child labor being replaced in some parts of the world with universal access to education).

Indonesian President Suharto has fired his Central Bank governor in defiance of international calls to drop the idea of fixing the value of the local currency. The bank governor was dismissed after a meeting with the president in Jakarta today. He was understood to have opposed the currency plan which President Suharto is pushing. The president wants to fix the Indonesian rupiah to another currency but the International Monetary Fund opposed the plan.
