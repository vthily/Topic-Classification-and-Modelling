Indonesian President Suharto has fired his Central Bank governor in
defiance
of international calls to drop the idea of fixing the value of the local
currency. The bank governor was dismissed after a meeting with the
president
in Jakarta today. He was understood to have opposed the currency plan which
President Suharto is pushing. The president wants to fix the Indonesian
rupiah
to another currency but the International Monetary Fund opposed the plan.
