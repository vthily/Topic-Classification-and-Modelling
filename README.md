# Topic-Classification-and-Modelling

This repository contains codes to perform Topic Classification (Using MLP Neural Network) and Topic Modelling (Using LDA) written in Python 3.5. The codes will need some inputs (Corpus and name list for nn.py, only corpus for lda.py) to be able to work. Both versions of `gensim` and `scikit-learn` are 1.0.1 and 0.18.1 respectively.
